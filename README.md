# DeepFashion Clothing Category Classification

**Module:** MSIN0097 Predictive Analytics — Individual Coursework 2025–26

## Project Overview

End-to-end predictive system for 32-class clothing category classification using the DeepFashion Category and Attribute Prediction Benchmark. The project compares four generations of computer vision approaches (HOG+SVM → MLP → ResNet18 → ViT) under data-limited conditions (10,000 images).

**Champion model:** ResNet18 with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters — 45.9% accuracy, 0.404 Weighted F1.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (tested on RTX 3070, 8GB VRAM)
- ~4GB disk space for images and cached features

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset Access

The DeepFashion Category and Attribute Prediction Benchmark is available at:
http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html

### Complete Project Download (recommended)

The full project including all images, cached features, annotation files, and pre-trained model checkpoints is available as a single zip download:

**[Download Individual-Predictive-coursework-WVQX7.zip from OneDrive](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/uceihln_ucl_ac_uk/IQBDOfn31kgDQrberRyn2guCAS6JHJjwiDm7AYONwn9mAz4?e=JdagYf)**

Extract the zip into your working directory. All paths in the notebook will resolve correctly without any additional setup.

### Files Not in Repository (size limits)

The following are excluded via `.gitignore` due to GitHub size constraints but are included in the OneDrive zip above:

- `data/` — subset images and cached HOG/PCA features (~2GB)
- `img.zip` — full DeepFashion images (2.6GB)
- `Anno_coarse/` — annotation files
- `models/` — pre-trained checkpoints (.pt files)

**To reproduce from the original source instead:** Download the DeepFashion dataset from the link above, place `Anno_coarse/` and `Eval/` in the repository root, then run the notebook from Step 1 — it will generate all subset images, features, and trained models automatically.

## How to Run

### Full Pipeline (requires GPU, ~2 hours)

1. Open `deepfashion_subset_builder.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code
2. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom
3. The notebook follows Steps 1–6 as marked by section headings

### Quick Reproduce (without retraining)

Pre-trained model checkpoints are included in the OneDrive zip under `models/`. To skip training and run evaluation only:

1. Run cells up to and including Step 3 (data loading and splitting)
2. Skip Steps 4.1–4.7 (model training cells)
3. Load checkpoints manually:
   ```python
   champion = models.resnet18(pretrained=False)
   champion.fc = nn.Linear(512, 32)
   champion.load_state_dict(torch.load('models/champion_resnet18.pt'))
   champion.to(device)
   ```
4. Run Step 5 evaluation cells onwards

### Hardware Notes

- **GPU:** Tested on NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8GB VRAM). Batch sizes are set conservatively (32 for ResNet, 16 for ViT) to fit within VRAM.
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum. Close other applications before running Steps 4–5. DataLoaders use `num_workers=0` and `pin_memory=False` to avoid memory spikes.
- **CPU-only:** The notebook can run on CPU by changing `device = torch.device('cpu')`, but training will be significantly slower.

## Key Results

| Model | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Weighted F1 | Time |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|------|
| SVM (Baseline) | 29.7% | 0.095 | 0.273 | ~43s |
| MLP | 35.3% | 0.123 | 0.330 | ~30s |
| ResNet18 (Champion) | 45.9% | 0.146 | 0.404 | ~8min |
| ViT-B/16 | 30.5% | 0.038 | 0.181 | ~15min |

## Agent Tooling

Two agent tools were used following a plan → delegate → verify → revise workflow:

- **Codex (VS Code):** Code scaffolding, pipeline generation, model architecture templates
- **Gemini (https://gemini.google.com/):** Bug fixing, structural improvements, report assistance

Full interaction logs are available in the repository root. The decision register documenting accepted/modified/rejected agent contributions is in the report appendix.
